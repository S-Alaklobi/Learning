		         <hr>
			      <p> In my twine project, I created a puzzle narrative and used Twine to bring it out by having readers interact through inputting text and clicking on hypertext to solve the puzzle. I also added images and sounds to draw readers’ attention and attract them to interact with the puzzle.<br>

                  <hr>
		          <p>For my Voyant visualization project, I chose four of his novels: The Pickwick Papers (1837), Nicholas Nickleby (1839), David Copperfield (1850), and Bleak House (1853). The goal of this project is to analyze these novels to find out how much they were influenced by Dickens’s social experiences.<br>

		           <p> For my Omeka project, I collected materials about Gettysburg battle history such as books, images, novels, speeches, and videos. This project contains not only items, but also collections and exhibits. Because of the battle’s importance in restoring the unity of the country, this site has been created for people interested in knowing more about the history of the United States and specifically about the Battle of Gettysburg.<br></p>

                   <hr>
		           <p>Since digital humanities scholars publish their work on the World Wide Web, it is important for first-year students to know how to reach and participate with digital humanities scholars and how to present themselves. Therefore, this lesson aims to teach students to use HTML and CSS so that they can learn advanced digital humanities tools such as Twine and take a step in the right direction to share their thoughts with digital humanities scholars.<br>

                     <hr>
		             <p>Since my background is in computers, I wanted to create a learning object for teaching HTML and CSS to interested distance learners. To create this course, I used Adobe Captivate, which is an authoring tool that is used for creating e-learning content.  However, as I designed this project, I considered how to provide interactivity to engage users. Therefore, my project includes simulation videos, a pretest, and a test to help learners deepen their understanding of HTML and CSS. </p>
